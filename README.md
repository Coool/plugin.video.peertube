A kodi addon for watching content hosted on Peertube (http://joinpeertube.org/) 

This code is still proof-of-concept but it works, and you're welcome to improve it.

# Functionalities

* Browse all videos on a PeerTube instance 
* Search for videos on a PeerTube instance (Only supported by 1.0.0-beta10+ instances)
* Select Peertube instance to use (Not implemented yet)

# User settings

* User definable preferred PeerTube instance 
* Number of videos to display per page (Not implemented yet)
* Sort method to be used when listing videos (Not implemented yet) 

# Limitations

* This addon doesn't support Webtorrent yet. So, it cannot download/share from/to regular PeerTube clients.
The reason is that it uses the libtorrent python libray which doesn't support it yet (see https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/issues/223)

# Requirements

* Kodi 17 or above
